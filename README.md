# My-Stata-Dofile
# Stata Skills Showcase

Welcome to my Stata Skills Showcase repository! This collection of do-files demonstrates a range of Stata programming and data analysis skills, from basic operations to advanced techniques. As a demographer and public health researcher, I've compiled these examples to illustrate how Stata can be leveraged for various analytical tasks.
## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a different aspect of Stata usage:
1. **Basic_Operations/**
   - Importing and exporting data
   - Data type conversions
   - Basic data manipulation (generate, replace, egen)

2. **Data_Cleaning/**
   - Handling missing values
   - Identifying and removing duplicates
   - Recoding variables
   - String manipulation and cleaning

3. **Data_Management/**
   - Reshaping data (wide to long, long to wide)
   - Merging and appending datasets
   - Collapsing and aggregating data

4. **Statistical_Analysis/**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - T-tests and ANOVA
   - Linear and logistic regression
   - Multivariate probit regression

5. **Advanced_Techniques/**
   - Working with survey data (svy commands)
   - Loops and automation

6. **Data_Visualization/**
   - Basic graphs (scatter, bar, line)
   - Advanced plots (combined graphs, marginsplots)
   - Customizing graph appearance

7. **Reproducible_Research/**
   - Creating log files
   - Writing flexible and modular code
   - Do files
